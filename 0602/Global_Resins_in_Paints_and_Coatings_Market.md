 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Paint pollution and its long-term adverse impact on the development of the paint and coatings industry. The main environmental impact of Paints and coatings is the release of volatile organic compounds (VOC) during the drying process after application. The resins used in these coatings are based on certain solvents and may have such negative effects on the environment. Acrylic resins are thermoplastic resins produced by the polymerization of acrylate or methacrylate monomers. These resins are resistant to hydrolysis, have good weather resistance, excellent glossiness and color retention, and are used especially for external applications. They also have certain other properties, such as transparency, UV resistance, and high color rendering for paint solutions. These resins are used in aqueous systems to reduce VOC emissions. High surface hardness can be achieved by using these acrylic resins. They are used in a variety of applications, such as walls, roofs and decks, where acrylic coatings are used to provide elastomeric finishes that improve the UV resistance of surfaces.</p>
