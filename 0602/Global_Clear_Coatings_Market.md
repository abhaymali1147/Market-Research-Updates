 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>A clear coating is a type of high-end coating material in a water- or solvent-based form. These coatings normally make use of advanced cross-linking mechanisms, which accounts for its superior bonding properties. Due to this, clear coating is beneficial for almost all metal substrates. It serves as an excellent replacement for rust or corrosion preventives that are based in oil. It is also stable under extreme heat conditions and can be topped with primers or paints without needing removal. When combined with other coating types, the clear coating can immensely prolong the lifespan of the metal surface.</p>
