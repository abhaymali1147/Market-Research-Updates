 <p>Zinc orthophosphate is an inorganic compound commonly used as a corrosion inhibitor in water treatment applications. It is particularly effective in controlling the corrosion of metal pipes in drinking water systems by forming a protective layer on the metal surface. This protective layer helps prevent the leaching of lead and other metals into the water. Zinc orthophosphate is often used in combination with other treatment chemicals to enhance water quality and extend the lifespan of plumbing infrastructure. Additionally, it is sometimes used in industrial applications where metal surfaces are exposed to corrosive environments.</p>
