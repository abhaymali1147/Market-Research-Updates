 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Zinc offers the optimal solution, when compared with the traditional Pb-Acid starter battery and the still young Li-Ion systems. Zinc has the distinct advantage of cost, energy content and operational performance against Pb-Acid in stationary batteries. Zinc is also cheaper, more available, more sustainable, (environmental impact and recycling) and safer than Li-Ion, making it a credible candidate for e-buses, scooters, bikes and forklifts in addition to on-grid and off-grid stationary storage systems in domestic and industrial power, telecom and emergency systems.</p>
