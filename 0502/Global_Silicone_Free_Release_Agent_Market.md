 <p><span style="font-size:14px">A <strong>silicone-free release agent</strong> is a type of release coating or lubricant used in molding and manufacturing processes to prevent materials from sticking to molds, tools, or surfaces, without the use of silicone compounds. These agents are ideal for applications where silicone could interfere with subsequent finishing, painting, bonding, or coating processes, such as in the automotive, aerospace, electronics, and medical industries. Silicone-free release agents are often formulated with alternative compounds like waxes, oils, or other synthetic polymers, ensuring clean release and compatibility with sensitive applications.</span></p>
