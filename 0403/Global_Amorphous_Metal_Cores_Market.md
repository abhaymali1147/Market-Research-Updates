 <p><strong>Report Overview:</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>The amorphous alloy is a non-crystal substance created by rapidly freezing liquids of high temperature. Because there is no rule of atomic arrangement, the energy loss (hysteresis loss) is small when the flux of magnetic induction passes through the iron core. In addition, eddy current loss is decreased because the thickness is approximately 0.03 mm, which is about 1/10 compared with silicon steel. Therefore, the no load loss (eddy current loss and hysteresis loss) can be decreased to about 1/5 of silicon steel&#39;s.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Amorphous metal is an alloy with a non-crystalline structure produced by ultra-rapid quenching (about 1 million per second) of molten alloy. Because amorphous metal has no anisotropic properties, which originated from a crystalline structure, and there are no crystalline grain boundaries to prevent motion of magnetic domain walls, it shows excellent magnetic properties such as high permeability and low loss while having a high-saturation magnetic flux density.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Amorphous metal cores are effective for most distribution transformers. They are ideally suited for renewable energy applications such as wind farm and solar power, as they typically operate with 20~40% low load conditions. Amorphous metal cores have been in use for over 20 years in liquid-filled transformers, and this technology is now being applied to dry type transformers.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Historically, there was an initial interest in amorphous core transformers which stemmed from the first oil shock in the mid-1970s when improved energy efficiency in power distribution systems was increasingly desirable. This interest fell away in the mid-1990s when energy costs decreased. Furthermore, the initial costs of an amorphous core transformer are higher than of a crystalline silicon steel core transformer: first, the amorphous material itself is more expensive than crystalline silicon steel and second, the saturation magnetic flux density of amorphous steel is lower than that of silicon steel. This means larger sizes of amorphous core transformers are required, which results in a higher cost per unit. However, the higher initial costs can be compensated by lower operating costs over the lifetime of the transformers due to their increased energy efficiency.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Nowadays, amorphous metal core transformers have become commercially available and are cost-competitive with conventional core transformers. There has also been significant technical progress in increasing the saturation magnetic flux density of iron-based amorphous alloys, resulting in smaller transformers and reduced material costs.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The amorphous metal used in transformer cores is a unique alloy of FeSiB (iron, silicon and boron) that is produced by extremely rapid solidification from the alloy melt. This causes the metal atoms to form a random pattern, as opposed to conventional Cold-Rolled Grain-Oriented (CRGO) silicon steel (a FeSi alloy), which has an organized crystalline structure. The amorphous structure, usually associated with non-metallic systems looks like glass - which has prompted the name glassy metal widely used for such materials.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The absence of a crystalline structure in amorphous metal allows easy magnetization of the material, leading to lower hysteresis losses. The eddy current losses are also lower in amorphous metal due to a combination of its low thickness and a high electrical resistivity of 130 -cm compared to the 51 -cm in CRGO silicon steels. Thus, amorphous metal has a much lower total loss than even the best grades of CRGO steel, by up to 70 percent.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Amorphous metal cores have a proven track-record of over 20 years in liquid-filled transformers and this technology is now being applied to dry-type transformers.</p>
