 <p>Polyether acrylate is a kind of photocurable coating oligomer, mainly referring to acrylates with polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol structures. Polyether acrylate has good flexibility and yellowing resistance, but poor mechanical strength, hardness and chemical resistance. Therefore, it is not used as the main resin in light-curing coatings and inks, but it has low viscosity and good dilution, so it is used as Active diluent.</p>
