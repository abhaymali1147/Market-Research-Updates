<h1>Lithium-Ion Battery CNT (Carbon Nano Tube) Conductive Agent Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p>The global Lithium-Ion Battery CNT (Carbon Nano Tube) Conductive Agent market was valued at US$ 830.3 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 7432.5 million by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 36.8% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Global <strong>key players</strong> of lithium-ion battery CNT (Carbon Nano Tube) conductive agent include Jiangsu Cnano Technology, SUSN Nano (Cabot Corporation) and HaoXin Technology. The top three players hold a share about 66%. In terms of product, multi-walled is the largest segment, with a share about 82%. And in terms of application, the largest application is lithium-ion battery for EVs, with a share about 64%.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The current preparation methods of CNT mainly include chemical vapor deposition (CVD), laser evaporation, graphite arc method, and hydrothermal method. However, due to the shortcomings of high cost and difficulty in industrial production for the latter three, CNT manufacturers use choose to use CVD. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) and single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs), are employed as conductive additives in lithium ion batteries. CNT paste is a new highly efficient conductive agent for Li-ion Battery, which can replace the traditional conductive agents such as carbon black, graphite & carbon fibre. It has some excellent characteristics of high LD ratio, big SSA value & low volume resistivity, can be used in various specifications of electrode materials, such as LFP, LCO, LMN, NCM, graphite, etc.</p>
