 <p>Low-solids no-clean fluxes are types of flux used in soldering that contain minimal amounts of activators and leave behind very low residues after soldering. They are designed to be used without the need for cleaning post-soldering, hence the term "no-clean." These fluxes help minimize the risk of electrical shorts or corrosion and are commonly used in electronics assembly where cleaning after soldering may be difficult or impractical.</p>
