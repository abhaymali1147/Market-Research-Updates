 <p>Nanocellulose is a term referring to nano-structured cellulose. This may be either cellulose nanofibers (CNF), also called microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC or CNC), or bacterial nanocellulose, which refers to nano-structured cellulose produced by bacteria. Nanocellulose is produced from plant/tree through cellulose extraction or cellulose derived from bacteria via a culture medium. Some parameters of nanocelluloses are as follows: Diameter: 5 nm - 500 nm. Length: 10s nm - 100s ?m. Specific surface area: 10s - 100s of m2/g. Nnanocellulose have many special properties, such as Natural & renewable, Biodegradability, Biocompatibility, High strength & modulus, High surface area, High aspect ratio, Chemical functionality (e.g. for modification), Dimensional stability, Moisture absorption, Thermal stability (~200?C), etc.</p>
