<h1>No Clean Flux Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p><strong>The global no clean flux market was valued at USD 1.03 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 1.45 billion by 2030, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.2% during the forecast period (2024-2030). The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>No clean flux refers to a type of flux used in soldering processes that is designed to leave minimal residue after soldering is completed. Flux is a chemical substance used to clean and prepare metal surfaces for soldering by preventing oxidation and promoting solder wetting.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>No clean flux is formulated with ingredients that minimize the formation of residues during soldering. Unlike traditional fluxes that require thorough cleaning after soldering to remove potentially corrosive residues, no clean flux is designed to leave behind a residue that is non-corrosive and non-conductive. This residue is generally considered safe to leave on the circuit board without compromising its performance or reliability. Therefore, no clean flux is particularly useful in applications where thorough post-solder cleaning may be challenging or impractical, such as in high-volume electronics manufacturing or where components are sensitive to moisture or cleaning agents.</p>
