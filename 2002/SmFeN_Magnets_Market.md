 <p>SmFeN magnet is an anisotropic magnet that is injection-molded in an orientation magnetic field after mixing and granulating SmFeN magnetic powder and engineering plastic PA12. SmFeN material does not contain metal Co and other heavy rare earth elements, and its cost performance is better than that of NdFeB magnets. Its oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance are better than NdFeB, which is 2~3 times that of similar NdFeB materials. Products are mainly used in sensors, motors, etc.</p>
