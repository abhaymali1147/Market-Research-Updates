<h1>Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p>The global Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) market was valued at US$ 362.1 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 1300.4 million by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 20.0% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Global <strong>key players</strong> of metal-organic frameworks (MOF) include BASF, MOFapps and Strem Chemicals. The top three players hold a share about 97%. In terms of product, zinc-based is the largest segment, with a share about 17%. And in terms of application, the largest application is gas storage, with a share about 61%.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) also called as Porous Coordination Polymers (PCPs) or coordination networks are crystalline material that can be readily self-assembled from metal ions or metal clusters with organic ligands. They display permanent porosity with the enormous internal surface area and large structural diversity and thus lead to a wide spectrum of applications including gas capture and storage, molecule separations, ion-exchange, drug delivery, sensing, catalysis, luminescence. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are (often) crystalline materials that possess nanometer-sized cavities and exhibit large internal surface areas (>7000 m2/g) decorable with functional groups. MOFs are synthesized modularly from molecular building blocks: organic linker molecules and inorganic nodes. owing to the (i) abundance of compatible molecular building blocks, (ii) many topologies in which the building blocks assemble, and (iii) post-synthetic modifiability, the number of possible MOF structures is practically limitless.</p>
