Nevertheless, diets for young pigs and calves, and even broilers, cannot fully utilize normal soybean meal as it contains a plethora of anti-nutritional factors that are not completely eliminated. More concentrated forms of soybean protein are available, derived either from whole soybeans or from further processing of soybean meal. Soy protein concentrate (SPC) is the most common soy protein used in diets for young animals.</p>
