 <p>FDA Grade Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPEs) refer to a class of elastomeric materials that meet the stringent regulatory standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in food, medical, and pharmaceutical applications. These materials combine the elastic properties of rubber with the processing advantages of thermoplastics, allowing them to be easily molded and reused.? </p>
 
 
 
 <p>To qualify as "FDA Grade," these TPEs must comply with FDA regulations, including criteria for food contact, biocompatibility, and overall safety. Common uses include medical devices, food packaging, and other applications where contact with food or the human body is involved. FDA-compliant TPEs are non-toxic, non-reactive, and free of harmful additives, making them safe for direct contact with consumables or skin.</p>
