 <p>The current metal processing industry is developing in the direction of faster processing efficiency and more complicated processing conditions. The cooling and lubricating effect of general cutting fluids cannot meet the requirements of the metal processing industry. However, the use of several additives can cause serious water and enviroment pollution problems and also can cause serious harm to workers.The pollution problems of traditional cutting fluids mainly come from base oils with poor biodegradability and additives that are harmful to organisms and the environment. According to the source of the pollution problem, researchers have developed some eco-friendly cutting fluids with good biodegradability and low harm to organisms and the environment. Eco-Friendly Cutting Fluid used nano minimum glycerin with good biodegradation and low biological hazard as a substitute for traditional cutting fluid.</p>
