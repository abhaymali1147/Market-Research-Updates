 <p>High purity iron concentrate powder refers to iron concentrate with iron grade higher than 71.5%, silicon dioxide and other impurities (acid) content less than 0.2% - 2%, and Fe304 more than 99%. The iron content of super iron concentrate is close to the theoretical value of pure minerals, so it is difficult to produce it directly by conventional beneficiation. Using common iron concentrate to produce super iron concentrate is not only one of the directions of technological progress in iron mines, but also an effective way to improve the economic benefits of iron mines. Super iron concentrate is generally made from ordinary iron concentrate through reprocessing. During reprocessing, the beneficiation process and method shall be determined according to the type of gangue minerals in the concentrate, the particle size of the ore and the symbiotic relationship with iron minerals.</p>
