 <p>POM (Polyacetal) resins, also known as acetal or polyoxymethylene resins, are important engineering resins with exceptional wear resistance and excellent chemical, thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties; as a result, they have replaced metals and other plastics in wear-critical applications. While one of the oldest engineering thermoplastics, polyacetal resins continue to be successful substitutes in traditional metal markets, at costs that are lower than those of many other engineering thermoplastics. Polyacetal resins continue to replace die-cast zinc, brass, aluminum, steel, and other metals in various end-use applications.</p>
