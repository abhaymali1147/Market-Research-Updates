 <p>Refrigerant is the medium used to complete energy conversion in various heat engines, mainly fluorinated refrigerant. It can be divided into ammonia, nitrogen, fluorine-containing, water and hydrocarbons, among which fluorine refrigerants with excellent thermodynamic performance are the most common. The third generation of hydrofluorocarbon (HFCs) refrigerants are represented by HFC-32 (R32), HFC-134a (R134A), HFC-125 (R125) and HFC-410a (R410a). Their ODP is zero, which does not damage the ozone layer, but the GWP value is high, and the greenhouse effect is significant. Third-generation refrigerants are widely used abroad. At present, they are in the early stage of elimination in some developed countries. Some developing countries, including China, have entered the quota reference period (2021 - 2023). During this period, the production and sales of third-generation refrigerants will become the main reference index for future manufacturers to obtain quotas. The replacement process of refrigerants is slow. It takes 8-10 years from the beginning of using a refrigerant to the end of the refrigeration equipment. There is still a large demand for the third generation of fluorinated refrigerants.</p>
