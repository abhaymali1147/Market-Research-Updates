<h1>Iron-Based Nanocrystalline Ribbons Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><br/><p>The global Iron-Based Nanocrystalline Ribbons market was valued at US$ 306.2 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 564.4 million by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 9.1% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Global <strong>key players</strong> of iron-based nanocrystalline ribbons include Hitachi Metal, Advanced Technology, VACUUMSCHMELZE and Qingdao Yunlu. The top four players hold a share about 68%. In terms of product, 18~22?m thickness is the largest segment, with a share about 43%. And in terms of application, the largest application is consumer electronics, with a share about 55%.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Nanocrystalline alloys are materials based on Fe, Si and B as well as Nb and Cu. They are produced in thin ribbons by rapid solidification technology, initially amorphous, and then crystallized in heat treatment at about 500-600 ? C. This results in the microstructure of very fine grains with a grain size of 10 nanometers - hence known as nanocrystals. These nanocrystalline alloys have low magnetic anisotropy and low magnetostriction, and have high magnetic flux density BS and good thermal stability.</p>
