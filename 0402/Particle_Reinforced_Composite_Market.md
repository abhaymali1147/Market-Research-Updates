 <p><strong>Particle Reinforced Composite</strong> is a type of composite material in which particles (typically ceramics, metals, or polymers) are embedded within a matrix material to enhance its mechanical, thermal, or electrical properties. The reinforcement particles can vary in size and shape, such as spherical, irregular, or plate-like, and are dispersed uniformly or non-uniformly in the matrix. These composites are widely used in aerospace, automotive, and construction industries due to their improved strength, stiffness, wear resistance, and thermal conductivity compared to the base matrix alone.</p>
