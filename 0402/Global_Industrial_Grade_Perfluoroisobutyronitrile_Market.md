<h1>Global Industrial Grade Perfluoroisobutyronitrile Market Research Report 2025, Forecast to 2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Perfluoroisobutyronitrile (C4F7N) is a new type of environmentally friendly insulating and arc extinguishing gas. The Greenhouse Effect Index (GWP) is only 2210, much lower than that of sulfur hexafluoride (GWP=23500). It can be used to replace the traditional sulfur hexafluoride insulating gas and greatly reduce the problem of atmospheric greenhouse effect. Perfluoroisobutyronitrile has been widely concerned by the global electrical industry and has begun to be used. It can be mixed with one or more of CO2, N2, O2, and air, filled into the sealed enclosure of medium-voltage or high-voltage equipment, and used in the electrical components of the solid dielectric layer.</p>
