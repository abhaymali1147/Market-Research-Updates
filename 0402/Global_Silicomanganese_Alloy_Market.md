 <p><strong>Silicomanganese Alloy</strong> is a ferroalloy composed primarily of manganese (60-70%), silicon (15-30%), and a small percentage of carbon. It is primarily used in steel production as a deoxidizer and alloying agent to improve the strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance of steel. The silicon content also enhances the steel???s ductility and resistance to oxidation. Silicomanganese is produced in submerged arc furnaces by reducing manganese ore with coke in the presence of quartz to introduce silicon.</p>

 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Silico manganese which is sometimes called ferrosilicon manganese, is ferroalloy composed of manganese, silicon and iron, produced by smelting manganese ore, manganese slag, and coke and quartz flux on high temperature. Mainly silicomanganese contains smaller proportion of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Manganese and silicon are crucial components in steelmaking. As deoxidizers and desulfurizers they improve mechanical properties of steel.</p>
