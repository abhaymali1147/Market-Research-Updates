 <p><strong>Fischer-Tropsch Catalyst</strong>: A Fischer-Tropsch catalyst is a material used to facilitate the Fischer-Tropsch process, which converts syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) into hydrocarbons such as synthetic fuels or waxes. Common catalysts include iron and cobalt, often supported on materials like silica or alumina. Iron catalysts are favored for lower-cost feedstocks with high carbon monoxide content, while cobalt catalysts are preferred for higher efficiency in producing long-chain hydrocarbons. These catalysts play a crucial role in industrial applications like gas-to-liquid (GTL) and coal-to-liquid (CTL) technologies.</p>
