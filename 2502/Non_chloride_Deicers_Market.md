<h1>Non-chloride Deicers Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>The <strong>Non-Chloride Deicers market</strong> refers to the industry segment focused on chemical products that de-ice roadways, runways, sidewalks, and other surfaces without the use of chloride compounds. Unlike traditional chloride-based deicers, which can corrode infrastructure and harm the environment, non-chloride deicers use alternatives like calcium-magnesium acetate (CMA) and potassium acetate, which are less corrosive and environmentally safer. These deicers are particularly prevalent in sensitive applications such as airports, bridges, and areas where corrosion control and environmental safety are critical priorities.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Non-chloride deicers are becoming increasingly significant in specialized markets, addressing the growing demand for sustainable and low-corrosion alternatives.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The <strong>global Non-Chloride Deicers market</strong> was valued at <strong>USD 266.60 million in 2023</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>USD 338.84 million by 2032</strong>, growing at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of <strong>2.70%</strong> during the forecast period.</p>
