 <p>Lead-free piezoelectric materials are a kind of materials that exhibit piezoelectric effect (the ability to generate electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress, and vice versa) but do not contain lead. Lead is a toxic heavy metal. In recent years, these materials have become increasingly important due to environmental issues and regulations related to the use of lead in electronic equipment and other applications. Lead-free piezoelectric materials have the potential to replace lead-containing materials in various applications and provide more environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions.</p>
