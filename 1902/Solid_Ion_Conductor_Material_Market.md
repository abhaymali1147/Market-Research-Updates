 <p>Solid Ion Conductor Materials refer to a class of solid materials that can conduct current through the movement of ions in a solid state. These materials are usually composed of ionic compounds, such as oxides, sulfides, etc., and usually require high temperature operation. In solid ionic conductors, ions can move through vacancies in the solid structure to conduct charge. This ion conduction can be applied in fields such as batteries, fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells, etc. Compared with conventional liquid electrolytes, the advantages of solid-state ionic conductors include high stability, high energy density, and long lifetime.</p>
