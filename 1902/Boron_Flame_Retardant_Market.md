 <p>Boron flame retardant refers to a kind of flame retardant containing boron element in the molecule. Zinc borate is the most widely used. It has good thermal stability and generally does not need surface treatment. It is often used in combination with self-series flame retardants. During combustion, gaseous boron halide and zinc halide are generated, and crystalline water is released. A glass-like protective layer is formed on the surface, which has heat absorption, covering and other flame retardant effects. Suitable for rubber, plastic and paint. Boron is selected as the main flame retardant additive because borate has a strong synergistic effect with other flame retardants, which can effectively improve the performance of the formula. Compared with other additives such as antimony trioxide, borate is a cost-effective and natural choice.</p>
