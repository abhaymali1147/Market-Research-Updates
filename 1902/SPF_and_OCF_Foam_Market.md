 <p>SPF is a type of plastic that is sprayed on as a liquid and then expands to form solid foam. It is used in construction and insulation applications. OCF is similar to SPF, but it is sold in aerosable cans and used for smaller projects. SPF and OCF are made from two different types of polyurethane: rigid polyurethane foam (RPF) or flexible polyurethane foam (FPF). RPF is used in construction applications where high strength and stiffness are required, such as in load-bearing walls or roofs.</p>
