 <p>Pre-engineered modular pipe rack is a type of industrial infrastructure that is pre-designed and pre-fabricated off-site, then assembled on-site to support piping systems in a plant or facility. The modular pipe rack typically consists of a series of pre-fabricated steel or aluminum sections that are designed to be bolted or welded together to form a support structure for pipes, valves, and other components. These sections are typically manufactured to standard sizes and configurations, allowing for easy assembly and customization to fit specific site requirements. The benefits of using a pre-engineered modular pipe rack include reduced construction time and costs, increased safety, and improved quality control.</p>
