 <p>Thermoplastic polyimide (TPI) is developed on the basis of traditional thermosetting polyimide (PI). Polyimide (PI) refers to a class of heterocyclic polymers containing imide groups in the main chain of macromolecules, and is one of the organic polymer materials with the best comprehensive properties. It has the characteristics of corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, damage resistance, impact resistance, low density, low noise, long service life and excellent high and low temperature performance (no deformation at - 269 ? - 280 ? for a long time); The thermal decomposition temperature can reach up to 600 ?, which is one of the most stable polymers. It has been widely used in many high-tech fields such as aerospace, aviation, space, automobile, microelectronics, nano, liquid crystal, separation membrane, laser, electrical appliances, medical devices, food processing, etc.</p>
