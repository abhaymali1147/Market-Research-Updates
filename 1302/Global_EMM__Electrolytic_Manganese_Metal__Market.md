<h1>Global EMM (Electrolytic Manganese Metal) Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><br/><p>The global EMM (Electrolytic Manganese Metal) market was valued at US$ 4.56 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 6.23 billion by 2030, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.34% during the forecast period 2024-2030.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>EMM (Electrolytic Manganese Metal) is a type of electrolytic manganese, which is a refined manganese product created through the purification and electrolysis of a manganese-rich solution that is made by dissolving manganese carbonate ore or calcined manganese oxide ore. EMM (Electrolytic Manganese Metal) is used in alloy steels and non-ferrous metal alloys for a wide range of applications. Manganese plays the role of deoxidation, desulfurization and alloying in the steel making process. Manganese in the alloy can increase the strength, toughness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance of the alloy. Due to its high purity and low impurity content, EMM has been successfully used in iron and steel metallurgy, non-ferrous metallurgy, electronics, welding, aerospace and other fields.</p>
